Hello there,

My name is Ronan and I am a systems administrator from Belfast.

I currently work for Fujitsu working on a proprietary legacy system called VME.

I am just beginning my development journey and plan on marking my progress using GitHub. If you've found yourself here, you're probably in the wrong place.
